* This is great. See the tip I added on the readme.  
* Pick a KPI
* Get started downloading some data, use tableau prep to wrangle it.  If you can't find the data, let me know and a pivot may be necessary.  Try to focus on data that connects the dots on the KPI you selected.
* On paper, create a 4-5 viz storyboard to see what you plan to do, this will help identify data you need to get.  I think a dotwhisker plot might be suitable for this: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dotwhisker/vignettes/dotwhisker-vignette.html
