# Decision Background

## Background

While there are approximately 80% of people in Canada who live with a disability, only 59% of people with disabilities are employed as of 2022, making them unrepresented in the Canadian labour market (Canada, 2022). In numbers, this equals to an estimated 1.9 million people with disabilities who are between the ages of 15 and 64 who are not in school or employed with approximately 852,000 of these people with the potential to work (Canada, 2022). Employed persons with disabilities are also more likely to work in lower-skilled jobs (Canada, 2022). Barriers to employment for people with disabilities include the lack of access to skills training and development opportunities, inaccessible workplaces, workplace bias, discrimination, and exclusion (Canada, 2022). While these facts are discouraging, people with disabilities still place significant importance on obtaining meaningful jobs that match their education, skills, career aspirations, and interests (Canada, 2022). By having a supportive work environment through work adaptations, changing the negative attitude around stigma, and ensuring hiring processes and work environments are as inclusive as possible, people with disabilities are more likely to find and maintain jobs (Canada, 2022).

While the Government of Canada may seem like the main body of governance focused on ensuring people with disabilities are being hired through the Canada Disability Inclusion Act, it is also the responsibility of the provinces and territories to provide legislation that works in partnership with that of the Canadian government. The federal government gives provinces and territories about $3 billion each year to provide individuals with skill training, job opportunities, career counselling, job search help, etc (Canada, 2025). This funding, while helpful may produce a complex network of disability employment support programs that are administered and overseen by various provincial and federal agencies rather than a single agency that provides a universal set of supports to people with disabilities (Wittenburg et al., 2013). This network fragmentation also makes it difficult to design, test and implement employment innovations as every agency must be convinced to participate in the testing of new innovations otherwise each would individually create their own improvements, adding to little progress overall (Wittenburg et al., 2013). Finally, some programs are decentralized or don’t have consistent metrics to measure progress across diverse areas and therefore makes it difficult to compare progress across the provinces or territories because of the diversity of the target populations and variations in programs that provide employment supports (Wittenburg et al., 2013). Canada currently has an Opportunities Fund for Person’s with Disabilities available, which is a program aimed to help close the skills and employment gap between those with and without a disability (Canada, 2025). It does this by supporting those with disabilities to find and keep good jobs, advance their career or become entrepreneurs by funding projects that provide skills training, self-employment activities, job placements, etc delivered by 3rd party organizations in communities across Canada (Canada, 2025). 

## Stakeholders

While people with disabilities, are the key stakeholders, as the decision made will impact them the most, other stakeholders include employers and organizations whose main focus is on those with disabilities especially in the workforce or who will be entering into the workforce. Employers will especially benefit from this decision, as many employers are currently unaware of the economic and cultural benefits, they gain from hiring people with disabilities such as allowing them to create a more diverse workforce (Canada, 2022).
