## The Wrangling Process

Step 1: Upload data to Tableau Prep
Step 2: Once uploaded, I cleaned the data for easier reading using "Clean Step"
Step 3: In this step I deleted many of the columns that were unnessecary from the table because they either had one output (such as the column "Geo" had "Canada" listed or because they had null values that were unnessecary. This left me with 5 columns: Disability, Unit, Value, Indicator and Year
Step 4: I changed the name for each to the columns mentioned above and ensured that each column had the correct data type (which they all did). 
Step 5: I then filted the data in the remaining columns, ensuring that any null values were not included
Step 6: In the plus sign next to "Clean Step" I clicked "Output" where I saved the table as a Tableau Data Extract and clicked the play button "Run all Flows"
